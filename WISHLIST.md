## What I Would Add
- I would complete the requirements so users can also filter columns to see total amount for each column.
- I would add a clear functionality for the csv upload, so the user has the option to upload a different or updated csv file without having to refresh the page.
- I would add a check to ensure users only updload csv files, solving for error handling.
- I would add more unit tests to check for function calls and logic.

## What I would change
- I would change the logic of the state so the previous order of a column, doesn't determine the order for a separate column.
- I would change the sort image to icons, so i can make use of the up and down arrows appropriately, so the user is aware of the current direction of a column.
